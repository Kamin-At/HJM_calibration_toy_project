# HJM_calibration_toy_project

## This project to develop and calibrated multi-factor model using HJM framework to estimate the expected exposure at default and CVA of interest rate derivatives and other fixed-income products. 
Overview
- HJM.py: Contains HJM_Model class (debugging and model improvement are in progress).
- Gaussian HJM.ipynb: Shows results of fitting simple models (multi-factor models are in progress).
- utils.py: Contains general functions (e.g., yield curve conversion and implied volatility calculation with root finding method).
- test_cases.py: Contains simple unit test cases. (I use PyTest for unit testing)
